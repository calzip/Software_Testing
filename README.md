Your first assignment is to design and implement a small class-roll maintenance system. For
each student, the following data is needed:
▪ Name (up to 40 characters)
▪ USF ID (10 characters)
▪ Email (up to 40 characters)
▪ Grade of the presentation (numerical value from 0 (F) to 4 (A))
▪ Grade of essay (numerical value from 0 (F) to 4 (A))
▪ Grade of the term project (numerical value from 0 (F) to 4 (A))
The capabilities the system must support are:
▪ Read/write student data
▪ Add/delete students
▪ Retrieve student data based on a search by name, ID or email
▪ Update any or all data fields
The system consists of the main routine and various functions supporting the capabilities.
There is no need (time) to implement a complicated user interface; a simple console-based
text interface would be perfectly acceptable. The way the data is stored in a file must be
made transparent to the user!
